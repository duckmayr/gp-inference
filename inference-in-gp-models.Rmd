# Introduction

Political scientists are increasingly mindful of the danger of misspecification bias [@HainmuellerHazlett2014], particularly regarding interactive effects [@BeiserMcGrathBeiserMcGrath2022; @BlackwellOlson2022; @HainmuellerEtAl2019; @ZhirnovEtAl2022].
A number of approaches to this problem have been proposed, including diagnostic tests [@HainmuellerEtAl2019] and modeling strategies [@BlackwellOlson2022; @HainmuellerHazlett2014].
Some political scientists have begun using Gaussian process (GP) regression, a model from the machine learning literature, in situations where misspecification bias or correlated errors are a concern [@CarlsonND; @ChenEtAl2022; @DuckMayrEtAl2020; @Gill2021; @MonoganGill2016].
However, as GP models were developed by computer scientists, most existing treatments of GP regression and classification [e.g. @RasmussenWilliams2006] focus on prediction rather than inference.
I derive the distribution of average marginal effects for GP regression and classification, and present a guide for political scientists on performing inference using these models.[^1]
(I have developed an R package, `gpmss`, that implements these techniques and provides a user-friendly interface similar to the familiar basic functions for general linear models in R.)
I then compare GP regression and classification against other methods of guarding against misspecification bias in a simulation study.[^2]
Finally, I illustrate the use of GP regression and classification models in two real-world applications.
